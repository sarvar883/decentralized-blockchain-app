This is a mini-decentralized blockchain app to transfer coins between users. 
This is the code for 1 node in the blockchain.
New nodes could easily be added by creating new public-private key pairs.

React and Node.js are used for client and server side respectively. 

This app closely imitates how modern blockchains (including Bitcoin, Ethereum) work, how they create and verify transactions via the Proof of work concept.
